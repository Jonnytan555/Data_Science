        "\n",
        "Expected Goals Models are an attempt to quantify how likely it is that a certain shot results in a goal. With this metric, we can analyze what happened in a game other than how many goals each team scored. Since the game is won with goals, and goals come only from shots (except for the rare case of an own goal), then the xG metric only needs data from shots to be developed. In other words, anything else that may influence how many \"expected goals\" a team would score has to happen via having more shots in the first place. For example, one could argue that if team B receives 3 red cards, then team A is supposed to score more goals (an increase in expected goals). However, in reality, having 3 more players on the field will result in taking more (and possibly better) shots, and it is taking more shots that will result in an increase in expected goals. Therefore, shots and their information are the only thing we need to take into account!\n",
        "\n",
        "In my opinion, an xG Model should not take into account specific characteristics or skills of the players who intervene in the event. I've read in some other places that xG models should account for this to be more accurate, but I strongly disagree. Yes, I know that if Messi is one-on-one with the goalkeeper the chances of it being a goal are higher than with any other player, or that if Ter Stegen is the goalkeeper in question then the probabilities of it being a goal may go down. But that is not the point of the metric. We are trying to standardize through thousands of datapoints how likely it is that any given player would score from a certain position in a certain situation. If the player is an extraordinary finisher, then he will probably score more goals than expected, and that's fine. If we start taking into account the skills of the players involved, it is my opinion that we would be taking one step too far towards the design of this metric and would become less meaningful.\n",

He also has taken a lot of shots from unlikely locations, and he does not seem to be good at it, since he only has 2 goals when his expected goals are 7.5. These shots may also come in situations after corners, in which players sometimes shoot from far away in any direction without any hope of making a goal, but instead for the ball to go out and reorganize the defense. So maybe these bad shots did make sense in a way and we should not be so cruel about it.\n",
